![](https://github.com/alexandrefelipemuller/powerfool/blob/main/diagrams/Schematic_Modulo%20AutoDuino_2023-01-04.png?raw=true)
The schematic represents a simple electronic circuit, potentially for a vehicle's monitoring or control system. Here is a breakdown of its sections:

## Main Power Source
- The main power input is denoted by `V+` and `GND` symbols.
- There's a stabilizing circuit with a `C1` capacitor for smoothing voltage fluctuations in VIN (12v).

## Analog Sensors In
- Two sensors (`SENSOR1` and `SENSOR2`) are connected through resistors to the analog inputs `A3` and `A6`.
- Each sensor circuit includes a diode for protection and a filtering capacitor.

## Digital Output
- The digital output section features two transistors (`BC548`) that control digital signals, likely to power devices or for signal processing.

## Interface
- A Bluetooth module (`HC06`) is wired for serial communication, indicated by `RX` and `TX` lines.
- There's a buzzer (`BUZZER1`) connected through a resistor and a transistor, used for audible alerts.

## Main Connector
- A connector (`CN3`) is illustrated with multiple lines for `DISPLAY`, `INJECTOR`, `SPEEDSIGN`, `BREAK`, and `SENSORS`, suggesting multiple input and output connections for various subsystems.

## Arduino Interface
- An Arduino Nano (`U2`) is shown with connections to digital and analog pins, demonstrating the integration of a microcontroller for processing and control.

## Digital Sensors In
- There are additional inputs for digital sensors, with a resistor and capacitor network for signal conditioning.

## Relays Output
- Several relays (`D9`, `D10`, `D11`) are connected, which are controlled by transistors (`BC337`). These relays likely switch higher power loads.

## 5V Output
- A separate output for 5V is indicated, which might be used for sensors
